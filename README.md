# Todo Challenge

## Challenge

The challenge is to build a Todo list as a mini front-end application using Angular.js.

Here are the core user stories:

```
As a forgetful person
I want to store my tasks
So that I don't forget them

As a person with limited time
I want to instantly be able to update my todo list (adding and changing entries)
So that I have more time to think about other things

As a person who actually gets stuff done
I want to mark my tasks as done
So that I don't do them twice
```

Here are some other user stories you may choose to implement:

```
As a person with a lot of tasks
I want to be able to filter my tasks by "All", "Active", "Complete"
So that I only see the relevant tasks

As a person who doesn't like counting by hand
I want to see a total number of tasks
So that I don't have to count

As someone who has done lots of stuff
I want to be able to clear my completed tasks
So I never see them again
```
## Getting Started

run `git clone https://github.com/dbatten4/todo_challenge.git` to clone this repo then `bower install` to install the contents of the bower.json file and `npm install` for the package.json file. 

## Usage

The app currently does not have the capabilities to be run on a server so run `open index.html` to interact with the UI. 

## Testing

The project uses karma for its testing framework.

Run `karma start test/karma.conf.js` to run the tests.
